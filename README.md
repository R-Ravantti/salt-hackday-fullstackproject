## salt-hackday-fullstackproject
My full-stack application for the hack day at SALT, developed at March 16 2023

### Putting the Minimum in Minimum Viable Product
With an easy-to-access database, a lightweight API, and a minimalistic frontend design,
this project perfectly showcases what one single dev in training can accomplish in one single working day.

### Self-deprecating humor aside, what is this project?
This is a simple frontend, backend, and virtual database, built using Next JS, Java, and Spring Boot, which allows you to select two [nondescript monsters that fit in your pocket] and see if they can make eggs, as well as add and delete monssters iiin the database.
